# namer_app

This is my first flutter app. I followed Google colabs tutorial. This app is simple with two screens. The first screen is where it shows a random word with two options next and like. If they user clicks on next, it goes to next word, if the user clicks on like it, saves that word in a favoraite list that the user can access through the sidebar when they click on the heart icon. And the favorite page these I can see how many items were added to that list and the user is able to remove items by clicking on the trash icon on the right side.
